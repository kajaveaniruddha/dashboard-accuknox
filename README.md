# Dashboard Accuknox

This project is a Vite-based React application located in the `dashboard-accuknox` folder. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6 or higher) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

If you haven't cloned the repository yet, do so by running:

```
git clone https://github.com/kajaveaniruddha/dashboard-accuknox.git

cd ashboard-accuknox
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the `dashboard-accuknox` directory and install the required dependencies:

```
cd dashboard-accuknox
npm install
```

Or, if you're using Yarn:

yarn install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

After installing the dependencies, start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Or, if you're using Yarn:

```
yarn dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and open the application in your default browser. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### 4. Build for Production

To build the project for production, run:

```
npm run build
```

Or, if you're using Yarn:

```
npm run preview
```

Or, if you're using Yarn:

```
yarn preview
```

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`: Starts the development server.
